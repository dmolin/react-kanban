# React Kanban
A work-in-progress Kanban board (think Trello), written in React+Flux while experimenting with the new technology stack.

The App is simple by design. At the current moment there's no DB (The whole board uses localStorage).

## Can I play with it?
Sure. The current iteration is live at [http://dmolin.github.io/react-kanban/](http://dmolin.github.io/react-kanban/)

## Technology Stack
- React
- Flux implementation (Alt)
- Webpack

## In the queue (to be done):
- Add more features (rich header, search functionality, card ids...)
- Add a Realtime Node backend [DeepStream.io](https://deepstream.io/tutorials/getting-started.html)?
- Add proper DB (NoSQL or RDBMS)
- Add Concurrency (multiuser)
- Redux?
